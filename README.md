# Higher or Lower Game

This C++ game tests your guessing skills by prompting you to guess a random number within a specified range. Players can choose from three difficulty levels and use hints to guide their guesses.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Programming language used to develop the game.

## Description

The game offers three difficulty levels—easy, normal, and hard—each with a different range of numbers and a set number of tries:

- **Easy**: 5 tries, number generated between 0 and 10
- **Normal**: 10 tries, number generated between 0 and 25
- **Hard**: 5 tries, number generated between 0 and 50

Players are asked to guess the randomly generated number within the specified range. The game provides hints on whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the actual number. Once the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts, the game ends, and players have the option to play again.

## How to Use

Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler and run the executable file. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the difficulty level and make guesses within the specified range. Players can choose to continue playing after each round.

## Usage

To compile the code (assuming the file is named `higher_lower.cpp`):

```bash
g++ -o higher_lower higher_lower.cpp
```

To run the compiled program:

```bash
./higher_lower
```

Enjoy playing the Higher or Lower game and test your guessing skills!

**Note:** Commands for compilation may vary based on the C++ compiler and operating system being used.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed!
